I had a friend in college who thought that English novels were something that only the elite could indulge in. She wanted to read when she saw me reading Bronte. So I lent her Wuthering Heights. She told me that she could barely understand the language and so stopped after reading 3 pages.

On a whim, I lent her Five Point Someone and bam!

She finished the book in a single night!

And she finished the other 6 novels of Chetan Bhagat in a week!

She happily told me that reading his books was effortless and she was proud that she could successfully read a novel in English.

Here's what I derived from this incidence :

We cannot deny the fact that many Indians began reading, in the first place, because of Chetan Bhagat. He turned non-readers into readers. He writes in a language which a majority of the Indian society understands. His plots, though predictable, are also appealing to the Indian crowd. He knows what sells in the society, he knows what his audience wants and he writes exactly that.

The man is responsible for that girl in the local train who is engrossed in reading 3 Mistakes Of My Life and that boy who wants to first read the novel 2 States before watching the movie, like any true reader would want to.

And that college friend of mine?

She now reads John Grisham and Jane Austen. But she wouldn't have reached there had her fear of the English language not been eliminated by Mr. Bhagat's novels.

So no.

Maybe Chetan Bhagat novels are not that bad, after all :)
